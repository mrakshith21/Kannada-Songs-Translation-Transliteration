How many times did it sing?
This cannot stop
There will be no end
The song of this love world

This is my love song Gold
How many times did it sing?
This cannot stop
There will be no end
The song of this love world

Listen To The Saradar
I'm you like dots
Come in bani
Listen Hammeera
I am you like birds

Come to life
Rainbow of seven colours
Do we love ourselves
Build a love nest there

Is this our love tune song?

This is my love song Gold
How many times did it sing?
This cannot stop

There will be no end
The song of this love world
