(S1) Beautiful without being called or heard

Why this silence in me.
Beautiful without being called or heard
Why this silence in me....

(S1) Always fill my eyes.

This is your bim..... b

(S2) Always fill my eyes

This is your bim.... b
To look at yourself
When you run...
Ah.... To look at yourself
When you run...

(S1) Without looking, without joining, why in me

This silence is called but not heard
Why shankara in me
This silence... Call but not listen.....

(S2) This is my beauty

You can see...... De.... A..

(S1) This is my ga... Meditation
For your service..... De
Flower your foot today
When inserted....

(S2) Without standing, why in me,

This silence is called but not heard
Why parashiva in me
E.. Silence. Call or not.
