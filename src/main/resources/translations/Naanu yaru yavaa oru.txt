Who am I?
No one here is ballori
Pisces steps
Bana's whereabouts are balloruntu
I haven't seen my color
Kamal in my own place
I am Kanwarlal
Kamal in my own place
I am Kanwarlal
 
Who am I?
No one here is ballori
Pisces steps
Bana's whereabouts are balloruntu
I haven't seen my color
Kamal in my own place
I am Kanwarlal
Kamal in my own place
I am Kanwarlal
 
I'm a believer
I can give your life for friendship
I am the enemy of the enemy
This is the hand of the traitor.
Stab behind the back
I can identify people
My Dareel Cross
This is where the borough enemy destroyed
On whose side am I aiming for
Who are you?
Kamal in my own place
I am Kanwarlal
Kamal in my own place
I am Kanwarlal

Color Color World
I wondered, My Eyes
Flashy
Female physique color
I know everything here
Rasika type of color
I'm a thief among thieves
Who's competing with me?
It's not wrong to talk
Never Anjonalla
There is no villa like me
Kamal in my own place
I am Kanwarlal
Kamal in my own place
I am Kanwarlal
 
|| Who am I?
No one here is ballori
Pisces steps
Bana's whereabouts are balloruntu
I haven't seen my color
Kamal in my own place
I am Kanwarlal
