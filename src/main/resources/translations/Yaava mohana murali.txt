Which Mohan Murali called you far away?
Which vrindavan caught your earthen eye
Flower Bed Chandra Chandana Bahu Bandhan Kiss
Karana Ganadi Ringana inside the fence of desire garden
Somewhere across the Seven Ocean awaits the dormant ocean
The silent marmara flew here today.
Your soul is in the hands of your life.
Life is where everything is left behind
