Bunnie, my friends
Bunnie, my friends

Friends, my friends
Friends, my friends
Spent that summer
Flower bloomed slowly
Let's go college
Tell Thanks age
Friends are my friends
Friends are my friends

Age without fear
Biology can be written
Old enough not to cough
Chemistry can learn
Old enough to have a moustache
History can read
Love is a springing age
Commerce can be heard

Bunnie girlfriends can drilling
Bunnee friends can see thrilling
I don't mean you
There is no male and female distinction
There's no place to worry
Jolly come all
Can't find age after it's gone
We are the love world that Kylie has

Bang, bang
Bang, bang

Hey spent that summer
Flower bloomed slowly
Let's go college
Tell Thanks age
Friends are my friends
Friends are my friends

Were there Classroomನಲ್ಲಿ
Commentary can be heard
Were there Cloakroomನಲ್ಲಿ
Timepass
Libraryಗೆಂದು

love scene can see
Laboratory went to
Ding Dong can see
Bunnie's friends can dance disco
Bunnie friends can jolly
Sun in moon pocket
Star spotted in fist
Eight Directions Our Kylie
We are here like kings
Seasons await us all our way
All year long, the harshness is ours

Bang, bang
Bang, bang

Hey spent that summer
Flower bloomed slowly
Let's go college
Tell Thanks age
Friends are my friends
Friends are my friends
Spent that summer
Flower bloomed slowly
Let's go college
Tell Thanks age

Friends are my friends
Friends are my friends
