It's like bringing the moon to the night of The Amavasya
He spilled into your life, Moon.

Arishina Kumkum Bhagyava gave you
The lap was filled with the excuse of flirting

My eyes dreamed a thousand
That dream came true for your life.
You got a privilege you didn't want, sister.
Your smile is the lamp of my life.
 
Aha haha lali lali song lali lali
Ohho lolly lullaby lolly lolly
 
Shiva must be in Parvati Kailash.
Shanmukha must come to witness their joy
Shiva must be in parvati kailasa.
Shanmukha must come to witness their joy
Ganga must leave shiva's matted friendship
The slippery distance must be the king of peace
 
Aha haha lali lali song lali lali
Ohho lolly lullaby lolly lolly
 
|| The singing of the song of love is over
The time for lullaby came near
Aha haha lali lali song lali lali
