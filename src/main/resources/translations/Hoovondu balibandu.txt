A flower came up and touched me. 
What, to ask, i said. 
A sweet word like Jane, 
A sweet word like Jane 

A flower came up and touched me. 
What, to ask, said, 
A sweet word like Jane, 
A sweet word like Jane 

I am the virgin of the Cauvery region. 
I am also the representative of Belur Bale 
Tunge Bhadreya, Tunge, Bhadreya, 
Taurina Hoo I, Taurin hoo I 

A flower came up and touched me. 
What, to ask, said, 
A sweet word like Jane, 
A sweet word like Jane 

I am the sun-radiant beauty 
I am the sister of the month's light 
Love, poetry, love, poetry, 
The flower of worship is me, the flower of worship is me.
