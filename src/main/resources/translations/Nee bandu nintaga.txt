When you stand, you stand and laugh. 
 When you laugh and draw, I'm defeated. 
When you stand, you stand and laugh.  
When you laugh and draw, I'm ||  

When Vasanti dances 
When Vasanti laughs greenly 
When Vanadevi puts her feet on the foot 
When a peacock calls, a peacock is on the lookout
 When a new life comes in the midst of a new life 
When the hand loses, the mind mixes 
That's what's new. Bara .. 1..
 When you stand, you stand and laugh.  
When you laugh and draw, I'm defeated.  

In a word like Jane  
In a word like Jane, kudiganna samchali 
 Smile is the flower of the mind. 
When confronted, i mused during the day. 
 Where is the end of the pain you brought 
Far away, you're going to go, i'm going to be a fraid, come on, you're beautiful. Bara .. 2..
 On the path of banana 
In the chariot of Olamba on the path of banana 
All the dreams come true and all the dreams are beautiful
 An age is a day, a day is a day. 
Sing impa as our flower 
In bitter ness in sweet, in the sun in the rain
 You'll always go together together. Bara .. 3..  
 When you stand, you stand and laugh.  
When you laugh and draw, I'm defeated.
