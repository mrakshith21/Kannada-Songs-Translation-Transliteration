Oh ho ho ho..
Oh ho ho ho
La La La La...
|| 2|| Odo Megha in Baa
Yoga is standing in the hill|| 2||
A place where there is no inclination
Come on, buddy, hurry up
|| Odo Megha in the mouth||
A mind-blowing bimba
Muthina beads are very much
Somewhere far-flung dot
The bird of girimugila towards it
|| Odo Megha in the mouth||
O take root in the soil
Absorb ground water breast milk
Stand green and live
Hey wind is a challenge for you
|| Odo Megha in the mouth||
Megha runs in her mouth
Soil is the place for rain.
Setu there and here
The talk is the midst of silence and silence
|| Odo Megha in the mouth||
