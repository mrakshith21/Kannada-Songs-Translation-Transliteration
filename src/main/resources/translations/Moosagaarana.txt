Hey cheat
Heart zero
Don't you want me anymore?
I'm very fond of asking, you're my life.
No faith, no conch
Bare heart, mind open
The heart has broken without you
Listen, my friend, this is what brings love.
World system

Cheat
Heart zero
Don't you want me anymore?

It's not day that's night
Not true as false
Love has no value in front of these Shakuni people
This world is just a problem with love
If you step back, there's no winning, come out
Why tears? Why Kangala? Come on

Bare heart, mind open
The heart has broken without you
I'm very fond of asking, you're my life.
Â No faith, no conch

Heart zero
Don't you want me anymore?

Can you sour the milk of love now
Why is fear not curdly for this sourness?
Even if i stop breathing, I'll go from here
Whatever the name comes up, i am your bid.
You're a fool, impostor, come on

Bare heart, mind open
The heart has broken without you
Listen, friend, love
What brings about this course is the system of the world
Cheat
Heart zero
Don't you want me anymore?
