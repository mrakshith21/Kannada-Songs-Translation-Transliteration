There is love, smile.
I came here as a flower.
I'm jasmine in the evening. My evening jasmine
 
There is love, smile.
I came here as a flower.
I'm jasmine in the evening. My evening jasmine
 
Your eyes. I saw me
Your eyes. I saw me
Day in and day out. Count Manadi
Multiply.. Want to leave
Defeat is today. Win this day...
What a arrest...
 
|| There is love, smile.
I came here as a flower.
I'm jasmine in the evening. I am jasmine in the evening..||
 
I saw honganasa, you for me
I saw honganasa, you for me
A variety of desires. Keep your mind. Save Memory
Without moving away... The thirst is over. Join
 
|| There is love, smile.
I came here as a flower.
I'm jasmine in the evening. I am jasmine in the evening..||
