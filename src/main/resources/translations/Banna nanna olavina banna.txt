Color, Color of My Inclination
The color of my life

Color, Color of My Inclination
The color of my life

You laugh green, cheerful breath
The colour of the spring of Noorase. Color. Color.

This blue glamorous eye is the colour of the banyan in beauty
Ranga's cheek was very much okuli colour that evening
Your father is a hundred and one dream color today.
The new love flower colour in the garden of Manasa
The rainbow that slipped out of the ban
Today I Have Put On The Stage Of Olavana
Flashy color in your naughty look
Something charmed and waiting today.
Color. Color. Color.

The beautiful forelock is the seductive colour of the black cloud
White ivory is the colour of your radiance
Whiter than foam milk, this is the color of your mind
The color of cold speech like fog in the morning
Your love is as deep as the blue sea
Your friendship is like a pearl gem.
Your love is like a chiguri brought by Chaitra
Datta colour as it fades in time
Color. Color. Color.
