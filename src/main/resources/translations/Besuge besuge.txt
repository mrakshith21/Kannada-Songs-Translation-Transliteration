Life is a beautiful weld

A young woman gets a wedge of shame
A longing for a blinking eye
A wedge of infatuation in youth
A bond of desire in my mind

Tune with cymbal solder
Ragatalake Bhava Solder
Tune with cymbal solder

The gita welds with emotion
Music welding with the song

A young woman gets a wedge of shame
A longing for a blinking eye
A young woman gets a wedge of shame
A longing for a blinking eye
A wedge of infatuation in youth
A wedge of desire in the mind

Two minds are bound to be inclined
Double-life bondage

Sweet mating is a bond of love
Januma Janumaku Is The Bond Of The Soul
