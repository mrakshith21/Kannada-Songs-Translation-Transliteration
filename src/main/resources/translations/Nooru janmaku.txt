One Hundred Births And Hundreds Of Births
One Hundred Births And Hundreds Of Births
Let's get a shower of love.
My soul is my life.
One Hundred Births And Hundreds Of Births
Let's get a shower of love.
My soul is my life.
One hundred births.

Life is romantic poetry, self-negotiation
The memory is the shadow of the rainbow
My bandali o.
She wrote my bandali chittara.
She can't find her self again.
She sang into me.
One Hundred Births And Hundreds Of Births
One Hundred Births And Hundreds Of Births
Let's get a shower of love.
My soul is my life.
One hundred births.

Ba sampige savibhava lahari hariye pannir jeevanadi
Come jasmine mamakara maya
All the happiness of the world is O.
May all the happiness of the world be dedicated to you
Let there be a hundred bitterness for me
Wait till the end.
One Hundred Births And Hundreds Of Births
One Hundred Births And Hundreds Of Births
Let's get a shower of love.
My soul is my life.
Hmmm.
