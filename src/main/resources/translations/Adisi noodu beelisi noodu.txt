Do it, drop it, and you don't roll over.
Do it, drop it, and you don't roll over.
No one will be bent over.
I always laugh at an ant like this, and so on.  
Do it, drop it, and you don't roll over.

Neither the hut nor the palace, the game will stop.
Be it elders or younger ones, there is no distinction.
Neither the hut nor the palace, the game will stop.
Be it elders or younger ones, there is no distinction. 
Play, hang, hang, or be happy or undisturbed

Do it, drop it, and you don't roll over.

He squeezed his body and gave sugarcane sweets.
The scent of sandalwood was coming up.
He squeezed his body and gave sugarcane sweets.
The scent of sandalwood was coming up.
The lamp is lit, the lamp brings light to the house, the lamp light.

Do it, drop it, and you don't roll over.

All that is hidden in the hands of the playman.
His life of mercy was filled with tears.
All that is hidden in the hands of the playman.
His life of mercy was filled with tears.
If the hand loses, the story of the doll will end and will end.

Do it, drop it, and you don't roll over.
No one will be bent over.
I always laugh at an ant like this, and so on.  
Play, drop it, don't roll over
