The flower that bloomed in the fire is Namma
I don't know my inner self.
I don't know my inner self.
 
Lightning clouds...
I don't know what rain gives.
I don't know what rain gives.
 
|| The flower that bloomed in the fire was Nanamma..||
 
Did a thorn pierce the leg
Tears throbbing eyes
If the pain is squeezed by the mind
Suffering is nayanas
Lights on the way
Beautiful eyes blooming
That eye can be seen in himself
Hidden pains
 
|| The flower that bloomed in the fire was Nanamma..||
 
The three in the temple
Black-looking rock itself
Without worshipping the stone.
You'll go away... 
Without drawing a hoody to the bow 
Who kills arrows..
Spark without reason
Words not to
 
|| The flower that bloomed in the fire is Namma
I don't know anyone who knows me.
We are the flower that blossomed in the fire.
I don't know anyone who knows me.
The flower that bloomed in the fire was Namma....||
