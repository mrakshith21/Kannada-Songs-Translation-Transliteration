Hey, why do you want a lamp?
Hey, my eyes are enough
 
Hey, why do you want a lamp?
Hey, my eyes are enough
Raja... Join Me
 
|| Hey, why do you want a lamp?
Hey, my eyes are enough
Raja... Join me. ||
When I stood like this, Raja saw me.
Raja when this female's complexion is full of eyes
Hee. Gay. K..
To the uncalled, the sorghum of the scab
To the uncalled, the sorghum of the scab
Why are you like this...
 
|| Hey, why do you want a lamp?
Hey, my eyes are enough
Raja... Join me. ||
 
I'm watered down, tears in my eyes
The sea is raja
It's all flashy
Nee Soke Jummanthu Raja
Come on. No. Du.
If I don't give up, you'll give it to you
If I don't give up, you'll give it to you
Come on, quickly...
 
|| Hey, why do you want a lamp?
Hey, my eyes are enough
Raja... Join Me
