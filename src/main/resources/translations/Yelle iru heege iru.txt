Stay where you are, how to stay, and always fill your mind.
Stay where you are, how to stay, and always fill your mind.

To the banana temple, you become god,
Merciful, you became the basis.
To the banana temple, you become god,
Merciful, you became the basis.
I can't ask, Varavena, you give me enough laughter.

Stay where you are, how to stay, and always fill your mind.
I want to laugh a hundred flowers.
Garland and bring it to you alone
I want to laugh a hundred flowers.
Garland and bring it to you alone
I saw it with my eyes full of light, that lamp.

Stay where you are, how to stay, and always fill your mind.
Always fill your mind
