What a man he is
What a pit are you doing 
As soon as Bhale saw Bhale.
Her wish cried
What a woman she is
What an eye you have for half an eye
Bhale Bhale Is The Same Noted
His mind was disturbed
 
What do you mean by pisces eyes?
What is the sight of Jane's lip?
See the form and what are you doing?
What do you want today?
However, you don't light up.
You were captured by the sight of it.
Why is this silence?
 
||  What a man he is
What a pit are you doing 
As soon as Bhale saw Bhale.
She wanted to shout...||
 
Marriage in life at once
Such a fortune is beautiful.
Milk Honey Is One Way
Love when the mind mixes with the mind
This appendix of yours
Debt bond of birth
Why this silence?
 
||  What a woman she is
What an eye you have for half an eye
Bhale Bhale Is The Same Noted
His mind was haunted...||
 
Make a dumbiase flower
The desire for cloud floats
The desire for the river is running
Your desire is in the eye
Before the Mars instrument rings
Aha mangale stream this face
That's what it's all about.
Aha mangale stream this face
That's what it's all about.
 
||  What a man he is
 What a pit are you doing 
 As soon as Bhale saw Bhale.
 Her wish cried
 What a woman she is
 What an eye you have for half an eye
 Bhale Bhale Is The Same Noted
 His mind was disturbed
 Not in Lalala
 Not in Lalala...||
