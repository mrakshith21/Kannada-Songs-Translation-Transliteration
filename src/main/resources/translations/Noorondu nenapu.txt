One hundred and one memories from the chest
It came as a song with joy
One hundred and one memories from the chest
It came as a song with joy
One hundred and one memories from the chest
It came as a song with joy
Sindoor point is called Nagalamma
Ilamma said this divine bond
One hundred and one memories from the chest
It came as a song and ॥
 
A flower like a flower brought by the love of love
Mudiyere nalivu, mudijarre pain,
When you get together, you dream like you've ever had
The beauty of luck. 
Love smile, live and shine 
Love smile, live and shine
You must be happy॥ 1॥
One hundred and one memories from the chest
It came as a song with joy
 
One thing that comes up on the lips
Three hundred and one left in the chest
This life is linked in three bundles
Happy to hear
Let me breathe in your harshness
Let me breathe in your harshness
I wish you all the best from this song॥ 2॥
One hundred and one memories from the chest
It came as a song with joy
Sindoor point is called Nagalamma
Ilamma said this divine bond
One hundred and one memories from the chest
It was a song with joy. Blissfully.. Blissfully
