I ran for you, i ran for you.
Why did you disappear, you disappeared?
Come running for you...

As if the wind had blown cold, I came to live, my father.
Father is the light of life, as if he could see the lightning in his eyes.
Join Snehadi .... Show me the crush..... Close by ... Join manavana.....
Eka...... You forget......

I ran for you, i ran for you.
Why did you disappear, you disappeared?
Come running for you...

It's like a flower wilting in the sun.
The thorn snare is caught, the crying is the mind is smiling.
Shore Nova .... Taladu Jeeva..... You don't see, what's left of me...'
Ekae..... You complained... I complained.

I ran for you, i ran for you.
Why did you disappear, you disappeared?
Run for you
