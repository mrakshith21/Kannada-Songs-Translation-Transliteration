Suryam and Chandram bandare munisu
The mother of the land who laughs is the mind
Suryam and Chandram bandare munisu
The mother of the land who laughs is the mind
If Rajam and Rani are broken, mind
Aramanya is beautiful.
Aramanya is beautiful

The house is full of creamy milk curd
Bhasaradha breath mixed with chest
A lamp of light and ghee for gudiya
Sididaithe Kwapa, Sididaithe Kwapa

Suryam and Chandram bandare munisu
The mother of the land who laughs is the mind
If Rajam and Rani are broken, mind
Aramanya has a beauty, Aramanya has a beauty.

The moonlight is outside the courtyard.
Black cloud veil inside the mind
Tulukaite Harusada Onalu
Love is a thunderbolt, a lightning bolt.

Suryam and Chandram bandare munisu
The mother of the land who laughs is the mind
If Rajam and Rani are broken, mind
Aramanya has a beauty, Aramanya has a beauty.

Front door rangoli managaite haya
All the smiling faces are old and sloppy
Ananda Santosa come to this house.
I folded my hands and said, "That my sivana, that my sivana.

Suryam and Chandram bandare munisu
The mother of the land who laughs is the mind
Suryam and Chandram bandare munisu
The mother of the land who laughs is the mind
If Rajam and Rani are broken, mind
Aramanya has a beauty, Aramanya has a beauty.
